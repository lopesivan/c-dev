c-dev
=====

miscellaneous c development programmes
usually stated in the main c file but at the moment
examples are coming from k&r's c book and oreilly's make

essentially just trying to teach myself c and get up to 
some sort of speed with it

each excercise is in a sub dir so i can build make files for them
